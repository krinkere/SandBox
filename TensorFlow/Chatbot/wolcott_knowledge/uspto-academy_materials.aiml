        Created in 1982 to provide for a single circuit court with jurisdiction over patent appeals from district courts and USPTO
        - Before 1982, regional circuit courts heard patent appeals from district courts. the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA) heard appeals from USPTO's Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (now the Patent Trial and Appeal Board)
        - The CAFC also hears appeals from other courts and boards, including Court of Federal Claims, Court of Veterans Appeals, Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), etc.

An essential part of the overall patent examination process is to determine whether those conditions are met for claims in an application. This determination is made after a complete search for the claimed invention is done. Conditions met: the claims lack "novelty"(unless an exception applies) and are therefore unpatentable (Result: Reject claims under 35 U.S.C. $102(a)(1)). Conditions not met: no rejection is made under 35 U.S.C. $102(a)(1) (Patent is not necessarily issued because rejections under other statutes may still apply 35 U.S.C. $101, 35 U.S.C. $102(a)(2), 35 U.S.C. $103, 35 U.S.C. $112)

        Any "use" or "on sale" must be "public". This is different from pre-AIA law where "sales" did not have to be "public". The "use" or "on sale" does not have to enable someone to make and use the invention under 35 U.S.C. $112(a). The "use" or "on sale" can occur anywhere, i.e., they can occur outside the United States. This is different from pre-AIA law where the "use" or "on sale" could only be in the United States. Relevant date for public use or on sale activity being used as prior art under 102(a)(1) - the date the actual "use" or "on sale" activity took place.

    <pattern>PRIOR ART</pattern>
    <template>
        The term "prior art" is usually qualified with a section of 35 U.S.C. $102 ("Prior art under 35 U.S.C. $102(a)(1)" and "Prior art under 35 U.S.C. $102(a)(2)"). Prior art under 35 U.S.C. $102(a)(1) is any "disclosure", as defined previously relative to 35 U.S.C. $102(a)(1), that meets the timing requirements for 35 U.S.C. $102(a)(1) and for which no exception applies
        The most common type of prior art is a reference document, such as:
        - Patents (foreign and domestic)
        - Patent application publications (international, foreign, and domestic)
        - Non-patent literature (NPL), e.g., books, journal articles, web-based publications, etc.
        Another type of prior art is applicant admitted prior art (AAPA)

        It is type of rejection based on whether or not the claimed subject matter is obvious. A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.

    <pattern>PRIOR ART 103</pattern>
    <template>
        For both pre-AIA and AIA applications
        - Prior art includes both the specialized understanding of one of ordinary skill in the art and the common understanding of the layman.
        - Most 35 U.S.C. $103 rejections are made based on prior art available under 35 U.S.C. $102
        - References that meet the "who," "when," and "where" criteria set forth in $102 to qualify as prior art are available as prior art to use in any appropriate rejection under $103
        In addition to references available under 35 U.S.C. $102, examiners may rely on, for example, official notice, common sense, common ingenuity, and obvious matters of design choice, provided sufficient explanation is set forth to establish a prima facie case of obviousness.

        For a particular claim, a rejection based alternatively under 35 USC $102 or 35 USC $103 is permissible under certain limited circumstances, e.g. rejections of product-by-process claims. Reliance on alternative grounds of rejection using 35 USC $102 and 35 USC $103 does not eliminate the need to explain both the anticipation and obviousness aspects of the rejections.

    <pattern>OFFICIAL NOTICE</pattern>
    <template>
        Official Notice is a tool that enables an Examiner to rely on common knowledge or incorporate facts not otherwise in the record, without documentary evidence (See MPEP 2144.03). In appropriate circumstances, Official Notice can provide facts to "fill in the gaps" to address small details that are being claimed and are known to exist in the relevant art, but which are not present in the prior art of record. Official Notice should only be taken by the Examiner where the facts asserted to be well-known, or to be common knowledge in the art, are capable of instant and unquestionable demonstration as being well-known so as to defy dispute. Taking Official Notice should be rare when an application is under final rejection or action. If Official Notice is taken, the basis for such reasoning must be set forth explicitly. The Examiner must provide specific factual findings predicated on sound technical and scientific reasoning to support his or her conclusion of common knowledge. It is never appropriate to rely solely on Official Notice as the principal evidence upon which a rejection was based.

    <pattern>112A FIRST REQUIREMENT</pattern>
    <template>
        Written Description - To satisfy the written description requirement, the specification must describe the claimed invention in sufficient detail that one skilled in the art can reasonably conclude that the applicant had possession of the claimed invention. Fundamental factual inquiry: whether the specification conveys with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date sought, applicant was in possession of the invention as now claimed (MPEP $$ 2161.01, 2163(I), 2163.02). An original claim may lack written description when the claim defines the invention in functional language specifying a desired result but the specification does not sufficiently identify how the function is performed or result is achieved. For programmed computer functions, determine whether the specification discloses in adequate detail the computer and the algorithm (e.g., the necessary steps and/or flowcharts) that perform the claimed function. It is not enough that one skilled in the art could write a program to achieve the claimed function. Establish a clear prosecution record by setting forth reasons why the application disclosure fails to provide written description support under $ 112(a) and thus the claims that rely thereon are rejected

    <pattern>112A SECOND REQUIREMENT</pattern>
    <template>
        Enablement - For enablement, the critical inquiry is: Does the specification provide enough information so that one of ordinary skill in the art can make and/or use the full scope of the claimed invention without "undue experimentation"? The specification need not teach what is well-known in the art. However, applicant cannot rely on the knowledge of one skilled in the art to supply information that is required to enable the novel aspects of the claimed invention, when the enabling knowledge is in fact not known in the art. Enablement can be shown by disclosing at least one method for making and using the claimed invention that bears a reasonable correlation to the entire scope of the claim. Failure to disclose other methods by which the claimed invention may be made does not render a claim invalid for lack of enablement (MPEP2161.01(III), 2164, 2164.01(b)). The critical inquiry is whether the specification provides enough information so that one of ordinary skill in the art can make and/or use the full scope of the claimed invention without "undue experimentation". Analysis regarding whether a disclosure is enabling must be based on a consideration of all the evidence of record related to the pertinent Wands factors and the evidence as a whole. Enablement issues typically arise with computer-implemented inventions when the scope of the claim is not commensurate with the disclosure, such that the claim would cover all devices for/ways of performing a function. Establish a clear prosecution record by setting forth reasons related to the pertinent Wands factors as to why the application disclosure fails to enable the claim(s) under $ 112(a) and thus the claims that rely thereon are rejected.

    <pattern>112A THIRD REQUIREMENT</pattern>
    <template>
        Best Mode - The best mode requirement creates a statutory bargained for exchange. Patentee obtains the right to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention for a certain time period. The public receives knowledge of the preferred embodiments for practicing the claimed invention. (Eli Lilly v. Barr Laboratories, 58 USPQ2d 1869, 1874 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). It is the concealment of the best mode of practicing the claimed invention that $ 112(a), is designed to prohibit. A presumption best mode is disclosed exists, unless there is evidence to the contrary (MPEP 2165.03 I). Rejections under best mode are rare and any such rejection should be discussed with your SPE or Primary Examiner.

        (b) CONCLUSION The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention.

        It is type of rejection based on whether the claims are sufficiently definite to understand the "metes and bounds" of what is being claimed. The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention. Statutory requirement for the inventor or joint inventor to define precisely what the invention is. Claims define the invention for which protection is granted. 35 U.S.C. $112(b) requires definiteness of claim language. The primary purpose is to ensure that the scope of the claims is clear so that the public is informed of the boundaries of what constitutes infringement. A secondary purpose is to provide a clear measure of what applicants regard as the invention so that you can determine whether the claimed invention meets all of the criteria for patentability and whether the specification meets the criteria of 35 U.S.C. $112(a)with respect to the claimed invention. Ensuring that the boundaries of the claimed invention are clear to one of ordinary skill in the art enhances patent quality and clarity. Establishing a clear written prosecution record of how the claim boundaries were defined prior to issuance depends on both examiners and applicants. Clarifying the record establishes a foundation for claim interpretation throughout prosecution and the life of the patent, which benefits the examiner, the applicant, and the public.

        35 U.S.C. $112(f) allows applicants to use functional language in a claim. Commonly called means-plus-function claiming. The claim must be for a combination of elements cannot use 112(f) in a claim reciting only one element (a "single means claim").

Furthermore, an applicant can obtain benefit of an earlier application under $$ 119, 120, 121, and/or 365 only if the earlier application provides section 112(a) support for the claim, which requires that the earlier application disclose every feature of the claim and the full scope of a generic claim.

    <pattern>TRADEMARK IN CLAIM</pattern>
    <template>
        Claim [1] contains the trademark/trade name [2]. Where a trademark or trade name is used in a claim as a limitation to identify or describe a particular material or product, the claim does not comply with the requirements of <![CDATA[<a target="_new" href="https://rdms-mpep-vip.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/current#/current/d0e302824912.html%23%23al_d1d85b_2ae65_215">35 U.S.C. 112(b)</a>]]>
  or <![CDATA[<a target="_new" href="https://rdms-mpep-vip.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/current#/current/d0e302824.html">pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112</a>]]>, second paragraph. See Ex parte Simpson, 218 USPQ 1020 (Bd. App. 1982). The claim scope is uncertain since the trademark or trade name cannot be used properly to identify any particular material or product. A trademark or trade name is used to identify a source of goods, and not the goods themselves. Thus, a trademark or trade name does not identify or describe the goods associated with the trademark or trade name. In the present case, the trademark/trade name is used to identify/describe [3] and, accordingly, the identification/description is indefinite.
        Trade names may be permissible in patent applications under certain limited conditions. Their meanings are established by an accompanying definition which is sufficiently precise and definite to be made a part of a claim, or In this country, their meanings are well-known and satisfactorily defined in the literature. See MPEP $608.01(v) for form paragraph and additional formatting and language guidelines. If proper identification of the product referred to only by trademark or trade name is omitted from the specification and such identification is deemed necessary, you should hold the disclosure insufficient and reject on the ground of insufficient disclosure any affected claims. If the product cannot be otherwise defined, an amendment defining the process of its manufacture may be permitted.

    <pattern>CONTINUED EXAMINATION</pattern>
    <template>
        Section 4403 of the "American Inventors Protection Act of 1999" amends 35 U.S.C. $ 132 to provide, at the request of the applicant, for continued examination of an application for a fee (request for continued examination or RCE practice), without requiring the applicant to file a continuing application under 37 CFR 1.53(b) or a continued prosecution application (CPA) under 37 CFR 1.53(d).
        To implement RCE practice, the Office has added 37 CFR 1.114 to provide a procedure under which an applicant may obtain continued examination of an application by filing a submission and paying a specified fee, even if the application is under a final rejection, appeal, or a notice of allowance.
        RCE is a procedure under which an applicant may obtain continued examination of an application in which prosecution is closed, meaning the application is under:
        - A final rejection or appeal
        - A notice of allowance, or
        - An action that otherwise closes prosecution in the application (such as Ex parte Quayle)
        An RCE is not the filing of a new application
        An applicant may obtain continued examination of an application by filing a request for continued examination (PTO/SB/30), a submission, and the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e) prior to the earliest of: a) Payment of the issue fee (unless a petition under 37 CFR 1.313 is granted); b) Abandonment of the application; or c)The filing of a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) or the commencement of a civil action (unless the appeal or civil action is terminated)

        - "Useful" - the invention must have a specific, substantial, and credible utility. "Utility" requirement see MPEP 2107 for Utility Guidelines.
        - "Process, Machine, Manufacture, Composition of Matter". "Subject matter eligibility" - these categories, as interpreted by the courts, limit the subject matter that is eligible for patenting.
        - "Whoever invents or discovers". A patent may only be obtained by the person who engages in the act of inventing.

    <pattern>UTILITY REQUIREMENT</pattern>
    <template>
        The utility requirement serves to ensure that patents are granted on only those inventions that are "useful." This is determined using a 3-pronged test:
        - Is there a specific utility
        - Is there a substantial utility; and
        - Is there a credible utility?
        Rejections for lack of utility should not normally be based on a determination that the invention is frivolous, fraudulent, or against public policy. (Consult SPE if this applies)

    <pattern>SPECIFIC UTILITY</pattern>
    <template>
        A utility is specific, if it is particular to the subject matter claimed. This contrasts with a general utility that would be applicable to the broad class of the invention.
        For example:
        - Providing a general statement of diagnostic utility, such as diagnosing an unspecified disease, would ordinarily be insufficient absent a disclosure of what condition can be diagnosed.
        - Use of a protein as a "shampoo ingredient" would ordinarily be insufficient as proteins generally as a class can provide this utility.
        - Providing a statement of a particular biological activity (e.g., sedative or paralytic activity) for a compound is a specific utility.

        An assertion is credible unless (A) the utility is unbelievable (incredible utility), or (B) the claimed invention is wholly inoperative. Incredible Utility: An assertion of utility is credible unless the logic underlying the assertion is seriously flawed, or the facts upon which the assertion is based are inconsistent with the logic underlying the assertion. A credible utility is assessed from the standpoint of whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would accept that the recited or disclosed invention is currently available for such use. For example, one skilled in the art would not accept that a device could be used to generate more energy than it consumes or that a device could be used with at least 100% efficiency.

    <pattern>UTILITY REJECTION OVERVIEW</pattern>
    <template>
        If a well-established utility is apparent from the application, do not reject for lack of utility.
        If no well-established utility is apparent, review the application for an asserted specific, substantial, and credible utility. If no specific and substantial utility is credible, then reject the claim(s) as lacking utility.
        - Rejection shifts the burden to applicant to provide rebuttal arguments and/or supporting evidence.
        - Rejection is made under both 35 U.S.C. 101 and 112(a), as lacking utility and lacking enablement. Rejection under both sections is required, because if there is no utility, the applicant has necessarily failed to enable the public to make and use the invention.
        - The rejection should include enough explanation to provide a clear record of the examiner's determination.

        - No -> Proceed with analysis
        Has the applicant made any assertion of utility for the claimed invention?
        - Yes -> Proceed with analysis
        - No -> Reject claimed invention under 35 U.S.C. $$101 and 112(a), for lack of enablement. "Applicant has not disclosed any specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention" (provide explanation)
        Does the assertion identify a specific utility?
        - Yes -> Continue with analysis
        - No -> Reject claimed invention under 35 U.S.C. $$101 and 112(a), for lack of enablement. "Applicant has not disclosed any specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention" (provide explanation)
        Does the assertion identify a substantial utility?
        - Yes -> Continue with analysis

    <template>
        37 CFR $1.132 affidavits are frequently submitted to rebut a rejection establishing a prima facie case of obviousness under 35 USC $103. A prima facie case of obviousness may be rebutted by evidence establishing that applicant's invention produces unexpected results. The affidavit should present a comparison with the closest prior art. The comparison must be under identical conditions except for the novel features of the invention. The unexpected property or result must actually be unexpected and of statistical and practical significance. The unexpected property or result must be disclosed or inherent in the specification. Unexpected properties do not necessarily have to be claimed to be considered. The scope of the showing must be commensurate with the scope of the claimed subject matter. Synergism is merely a property like any other property, it may be expected or unexpected depending on the particular art. "Unexpected results" is a secondary consideration with respect to obviousness. It is not relevant to anticipation under 35 USC $102.

        Appellant must pay the appeal forwarding fee within the later of two months of the date of the examiner's answer or a decision refusing to grant a petition under 37 CFR $1.181 to designate a new ground of rejection in the examiner's answer [37 CFR $41.45(a)]. Failure to pay the fee set forth in 37 CFR $41.20(b)(4) will result in dismissal of the appeal. After dismissal, the Tech Center will determine whether any allowable claims remain in the application or determine that the application stands abandoned. The period set forth in $41.45(a) cannot be extended by paying for an extension of time under 37 CFR $1.136(a)

    <pattern>BROADEST REASONABLE INTERPRETATION</pattern>
    <template>
        Claims must be given their broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI) consistent with the supporting description (specification). Broadest reasonable interpretation leads to consideration of the following:
        - Plain meaning of claim terms
        - Explicit definitions, if any, in the specification
        - Functional language
            o Intended use statements
            o Wherein/whereby clauses
            o Capability
        Broadest reasonable interpretation by the examiner reduces the possibility that the claim, once issued, will be interpreted more broadly than is justified. Applicant has the opportunity to amend the claims during prosecution. The USPTO's interpretation of claims in applications differs from how a court interprets claims an infringement case of an issued patent.

        Words and phrases in claims must be given their "plain meaning" as understood by one having ordinary skill in the art unless such meaning is inconsistent with a clearly expressed redefinition stated in the specification. The ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e., as of the effective filing date of the patent application.

    <pattern>FUNCTIONAL LIMITATION</pattern>
    <template>
        A functional limitation is an attempt to define something by what it does, rather than by what it is (e.g., as evidenced by its specific structure or specific ingredients). A functional limitation is often used in association with an element, ingredient, or step of a process to define a particular capability or purpose that is served by the recited element, ingredient or step (MPEP $2173.05(g))

<category>
    <pattern>INTENDED USE LIMITATION</pattern>
    <template>
        An intended use statement may be found within the body of the claim or in the preamble. An intended use limitation may impart a structural limitation that is otherwise not found in the claim language, i.e., the reference may meet all recited structural limitations but still might not be capable of performing the intended use (MPEP $ 2111.02 (II); and Metabolite Labs., Inc. v. Corp. of Am. Holdings, 370 F.3d 1354, 1358-62, 71 USPQ2d 1081, 1084-87 (Fed. Cir. 2004).)
        Examples of Intended Use Phrases:
        Claim limitations that employ phrases of the type:
        - "ADAPTED TO"
        - "CAPABLE OF"
        - "SUFFICIENT TO"
        - "FOR" doing something
        are typical of claim limitations which may not distinguish over prior art according to the principle of intended use. It has been held that the recitation that an element is "ADAPTED TO" perform or is "CAPABLE OF" performing a function is not a positive limitation but only requires the ability to so perform

        The PCT is an international treaty that simplifies the process of filing foreign patent applications. Applicants file an international application, usually in their home country's patent office. The international application may include a priority claim to a corresponding application filed:
        - Within the previous 12 months, or
        - Within 14 months if a request for restoration has been granted to restore the priority right in the international phase
        A single international application has the effect of a regular national application in all contracting states to the PCT, as of the international filing date. Applicant receives an early indication of pertinent prior art and a written opinion as to the novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability of the claimed invention.

        (d) REFERENCE IN DEPENDENT FORMS.—Subject to subsection (e), a claim in dependent form shall contain a reference to a claim previously set forth and then specify a further limitation of the subject matter claimed. A claim in dependent form shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the limitations of the claim to which it refers.

        35 U.S.C. $112(d) states in pertinent part: [A] claim in dependent form shall contain a reference to a claim previously set forth and then specify a further limitation of the subject matter claimed. A claim in dependent form shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the limitations of the claim to which it refers. For example: Claim 1. A product comprising [recites limitations A, B, C, and D]. Claim 2. The product of claim 1 which further comprises [E].
        Under 35 U.S.C. $112(d), a dependent claim is required to: Contain a reference to a previous claim, and Specify a further limitation of the subject matter claimed. If it does not satisfy these requirements, the claim should be rejected under 35 U.S.C. $112(d), rather than being objected to, and then examined on the merits. (MPEP $608.01(n)(II and III))

        Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593 (2010), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States holding that the machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for determining the patent eligibility of a process, but rather "a useful and important clue, an investigative tool, for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under § 101."[1] In so doing, the Supreme Court affirmed the rejection of an application for a patent on a method of hedging losses in one segment of the energy industry by making investments in other segments of that industry, on the basis that the abstract investment strategy set forth in the application was not patentable subject matter.

    <template>
        An information disclosure statement (often abbreviated as IDS) refers to a submission of relevant background art or information to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) by an applicant for a patent during the patent prosecution process. There is a duty on all patent applicants to disclose prior art or background information that may be relevant to the patentability of the applicant's invention, as established by the United States Code title 35 and related sections of 37 CFR and the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP). If a patent applicant knowingly or intentionally fails to submit prior art to the USPTO, then any patent that later issues from the patent application may be declared unenforceable. Furthermore, the duty to submit such relevant information to the USPTO lies not only on the applicant or inventor, but also on any patent attorney or other legal staff employed by the applicant.
